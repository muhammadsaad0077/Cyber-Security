IP Addresses - 2:-

Let's say
IP Address 192.168.1.3

Subnet 255.255.255.0

Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

Now the subnet here shows that three octets (network portion) will always remain same for every device connected within network and 4th octet will be unique.

And suppose that 3 to 4 devices are connected in a network, first device share a img and its destination ip address is 192.168.1.5, by looking at three octets your device will know that
it is the device in my network and share that information to the device.

but if the destination ip address is something 132.12.3.2 then device will go to default gateway (your router) and then router continue this further communication.

192.168.1.0 (first address, This address identifies the network itself)    192.168.1.1  (default gateway)    192.168.1.255 (broadcast Address, it will share the packets to each device on a subnet) these addresses cannot be used by any device within a network, kind of like a reserved addresses. 


IP addresses are further divided into the different classes A, B, C, D, E, 127.0.0.1 (Subnet 255.0.0.0 ) are loop back addresses, they are kind of for testing our network.
CLASS A Subnet 255.0.0.0
CLASS A Subnet 255.255.0.0
CLASS A Subnet 255.255.255.0


Subnet Mask:- Usually we have this subnet 255.255.255.0 meaning that only 256 - 2 = 254 are available addresses within a network. But what if we have more devices than 254, here comes the subnet masking, we
actually change the subnet mask then   11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000  if we need more IP addresses then 11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000  ( 1s are called network bits and 0s are called host bits).
(There should be contiguous 1 or 0. There should be no possibility of that pair in IP Address e.g  11011001 

Basically number of IP Address = 2 to the power no of zeros in a subnet - 2 so now number of zeros become 9 and hence we have 512 IP Address available. 
No of IP Address = 2^no of zeros/host bits - 2


We can divide our main network into multiple networks/subnets using Subnetting Technique
It follows the rule 
1- Calculate how many host bits you need to hack  (means that how many subnets you want to make within a network like 4, 5 17 etc )

2- Hack/Manipulate the host bits from left to right ( 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 to  11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000  if we have to make 4 subnets). If we have to make 5 subnets then we need 3 bits to manipulate. basically the power that covering over no of subnets.

(              2^8      2^7     2^6     2^5     2^4    2^3    2^2    2^1    )
(              256      128      64      32      16     8      4      2     )        Normal table to calculate the no of manipulate bitss


3- Calculate the increment ( Decimal value of last network/1s bit)

(              2^7      2^6     2^5     2^4     2^3    2^2    2^1    2^0    )
(              128      64      32      16      8     4      2      1     )       Binary to decimal conversion Table

so in case of 4 subnets    11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000   we have last network bit at 64 decimal value so its mean our increment is 64.



Representation:-  255.255.255.192 / 26  (26 shows the no of network bits)

Our 4 subnets IP range will be 


1-  192.168.1.0  -   192.168.1.63

2- 192.168.1.64  -   192.168.1.127

3- 192.168.1.128  -   192.168.1.191

4- 192.168.1.192  -   192.168.1.255



Task:- Create 5 subnets from this subnet 255.255.255.0

11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 to  11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000   we manipulated 3 bits as 5 comes under this power

Increment is 32  as the last network bit is on decimal value 32.

Representation:-  255.255.255.224 / 27  (27 shows the no of network bits)

Our 5 subnets IP range will be 


1-  192.168.1.0  -   192.168.1.31

2- 192.168.1.32  -   192.168.1.63

3- 192.168.1.64  -   192.168.1.95

4- 192.168.1.96  -   192.168.1.127

5- 192.168.1.128  -   192.168.1.159


On the basis of number of host
Task:- Coffee shop has 3 divisions where each division has 40 host do subnetting for them

- So 40 host comes under the power of 6, this time we need to save the bits from right to left and manipulate the remaining ones.

11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000   to   11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000


Now the increment is 64 


Representation:-  255.255.255.192 / 26  (26 shows the no of network bits)

Our 3 subnets IP range will be 


1-  192.168.1.0  -   192.168.1.63

2- 192.168.1.64  -   192.168.1.127

3- 192.168.1.128  -   192.168.1.191   ( 3 because we need for 3 divisions )




11111111.11111111.11111000.00000000

255.255.248.0


Task: Factor Needs 4 subnets for
guest  10
robots    57    These number shows the no of hosts
server    26
workers   117

factory Ip address is 172.21.42.0 / 24


Solution: We will start from the category that require largest host (like here workers ) and then continue in the large to small order. We will continue the other subnet from where first one was finished. Rest the concepts are same

CSRF (Cross site request forgery)
Meaning that user logged into the website A and visiting the website B then the website B can make unethical requests to website A. More technically

A malicious website tricks a logged-in user’s browser into sending a GET or POST request to another website without the user’s consent.

To avoid this CSRF token is used, which is a random string generated by the server when client first send a request to the user. Due to this the website
knows that request is coming from my origin or any malicious origin.

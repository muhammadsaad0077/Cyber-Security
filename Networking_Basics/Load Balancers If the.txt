Load Balancers:
If the website traffic is high then one server can't manage it, then our call goes to load balancer and it 
then check which server is least busy (by running some algorithm like robin round ) and then transfer request to that server. Load balancer also check server health by periodically sending request to the server


CDN - Content Delivery Network
It is a excellent resource to manage traffic of busy website by putting its static files like js, css, images, videos on the thousands of the server all over the world, when
user request those files CDN look in nearest server and respond to the user


WAF - Web Application Firewall
It is between the client and the web server, it avoid web server from common web attacks and also for rate limiting which ensures each IP address can make limited call to the server in a second, it 
drops malicious request


Web Server
web server software:- Apache, nginx, Node JS

Virtual Hosts
You can host multiple website on the web server, it recognize the requested domain name from virtual host (that actually are configuration files ). If server finds a match then it respond with that web server address, if not then default website will be provided

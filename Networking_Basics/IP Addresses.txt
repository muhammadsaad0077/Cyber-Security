IP Addresses - 2:-   (Also there is my article on medium for 1st part but generally the things are cover here also)

Let's say
IP Address 192.168.1.3

Subnet 255.255.255.0

Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

Now the subnet here shows that three octets (network portion) will always remain same for every device connected within network and 4th octet will be unique.

And suppose that 3 to 4 devices are connected in a network, first device share a img and its destination ip address is 192.168.1.5, by looking at three octets your device will know that
it is the device in my network and share that information to the device.

but if the destination ip address is something 132.12.3.2 then device will go to default gateway (your router) and then router continue this further communication.

192.168.1.0 (first address, This address identifies the network itself)    192.168.1.1  (default gateway)    192.168.1.255 (broadcast Address, it will share the packets to each device on a subnet) these addresses cannot be used by any device within a network, kind of like a reserved addresses. 


IP addresses are further divided into the different classes A, B, C, D, E, 127.0.0.1 (Subnet 255.0.0.0 ) are loop back addresses, they are kind of for testing our network.
CLASS A Subnet 255.0.0.0
CLASS A Subnet 255.255.0.0
CLASS A Subnet 255.255.255.0

- IP Address related questions

so its mean now ipv6 are used but we always seen address in 145.231.233.1 ?

Short answer: Yes, IPv6 is used today, but IPv4 is still everywhere, which is why you mostly see addresses like 145.231.233.1.

Let’s clear it step-by-step.

1️⃣ Why do we still see IPv4 addresses?

Even though IPv6 exists:

✅ IPv4 is still the default face of the internet

Most websites

Many apps

Many networks
still support IPv4 because:

Old systems depend on it

It’s simpler

Replacing everything is expensive

So your browser often shows:

145.231.233.1   ← IPv4

2️⃣ Is IPv6 actually being used right now?

👉 YES, silently in the background

An IPv6 address looks like:

2405:201:600a:1c3a:8c2e:91ff:fe3a:7b21


You don’t see it because:

Apps hide it

Tools prefer IPv4 when both are available

This is called Dual Stack.

3️⃣ Dual Stack (MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPT)

Your device usually has both:

IPv4 address ✅

IPv6 address ✅

When you visit a website:

Device checks: IPv6 available?

If yes → use IPv6

If not → fall back to IPv4

📌 You see IPv4, but IPv6 may still be used.

4️⃣ NAT makes IPv4 look alive (but it’s not)

Millions of users share one IPv4 public address using NAT.

Example:

Your phone      → 192.168.1.10
Your laptop    → 192.168.1.11
Public IP      → 145.231.233.1


👉 That 145.231.233.1 might be shared by hundreds of users.

(Basically through NAT and port ipv4 is still available).

Firewall:

It is a hardware or a software that monitor the incoming and out-coming traffic based on security rules.


What a Firewall Normally Does (Without VPN)

Firewall checks things like:

Destination IP 

Port number 

Protocol (HTTP, FTP, SSH, etc.)

Sometimes application data (DPI)

Example:

You → Facebook → Port 443
Firewall → "Facebook is blocked ❌"


➡ Blocked.

What Changes When You Use a VPN

When VPN is ON:

You → VPN Server (encrypted) → Facebook

What the firewall sees:

Destination: VPN server IP

Port: 443 (HTTPS)

Data: Encrypted

What the firewall CANNOT see:

Which website you are visiting

Which app you are using

What data you are sending

So firewall thinks:

“Oh, this is just normal HTTPS traffic 😄”

Types:

1- Packet Filtering Firewall: First gen, basic firewall, examine basic packet info
cons: limited context, vulnerable to spoofing, no application awareness

2- Stateful inspection firewall: Second gen, maintain a state table to track active connections. Allows legitimate ( meaning that it first time check your id, next time allow you without checking id because it
remember who has visited before ) return traffic automatically.

3- Proxy Firewalls (Application-Level Gateways - Third Gen): It does a deep packet inspection, works on the application layer, examine the packet deeply that which information it contain, from where it is coming,
where it going, what it contain, is it contain something that is on the denied list, if all okay then transfer to the destination.

Cons: Performance overhead (latency), application-specific

4- Next generation firewalls: Combine traditional functions with advanced features like IPS(intrusion provision system), application control, and threat intelligence.
Cons: more complex, higher cost

Limitations
Can be bypassed by APTs/zero-days

OSI Model
Open systems interconnection model

has 7 layers

- Application
Users interact with, GUI


- Presentation
Act as a translator so the devices have different software/hardware can receive the same information

- Session
When two user on the same page a session is created and it synchronizes the two user to be on the same page before data is send or received.


- Transport
helps in transmitting data across a network

When data is sent between two devices it follows the two protocol - TCP and UDP

TCP - Transmission control protocol 
ensures reliability between the connection, incorporates error checking into its design, guarantee the accuracy of the data

if one chunk of data is not received then entire block of data can't be made, slower than UDP
usually used in file sharing, internet browsing and email.

UDP - User Datagram Protocol
does not reliable as TCP
much faster 

Useful for discovering devices (DHCP, ARP), video streaming


_ Network Layer
Where magic of routing & re-assembly of data takes place, routing also determines the optimal path for data sharing

Decision takes at this layer are
 - What path is the shortest
 - What path is the most reliable 
 - Which path has the faster physical connection
 
 
 - Data Link Layer
 focuses on physical transmission of the data 
 
 - Physical Layer
 include hardware to make connection possible
 
 
 Port forwarding:
 - Port forwarding is configured at the router of the network, and it shares the local address to the public so everyone can use it.

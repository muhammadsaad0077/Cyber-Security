DNS

Make communication possible on internet, we don't have to remember IP addresses we only need to remember URL and it automatically converts the url into the
required IP address.

TLD: top level domain
.com , .gov , .org , .edu


Second level domain: 
google  , youtube , tryhackme

Subdomain
admin.tryhackme.com


Domain record types are different kinds of entries stored in the DNS (Domain Name System) that tell the internet how to handle requests for a domain (like where to send website traffic, emails, etc.).

In simple words:
They are instructions that tell the internet “what should happen when someone uses this domain name.”

For example, when you type a website name, DNS records help convert it into the server’s IP address and tell services like email where to go.

Most Common Domain (DNS) Record Types
 1. A Record (Address)

Maps domain → IPv4 address

Example: example.com → 192.168.1.1

This is the most basic and common record.

 2. AAAA Record

Same as A record but for IPv6 address.

 3. CNAME (Canonical Name)

Makes one domain an alias of another domain

Example: www.example.com → example.com

 4. MX (Mail Exchange)

Tells where emails for the domain should go

Can include priority if multiple mail servers exist.

 5. TXT Record

Stores text info (often for verification or email security like SPF/DKIM).

 6. NS (Name Server)

Tells which DNS servers are authoritative for the domain.


What happens when you make a DNS request
- first it looks into your router cache
- if not found then it looks in recursive server which is provided by the ISP
- if there not found then it connect your device to Root DNS Servers then it redirects to the Authoritative DNS Server which have all the records

OWASP: List of most critical web application security risks published by OWASP ( Open Worldwide Application Security Project ). Its widely used
by developers, security engineers and cybersecurity students 

1- Broken Acces Control

2- Security Misconfuguration
Keeping your software open in terms of security, it can be in a way that you set default passwords, unauthorize access to anyone meaning that simple user can access admin role or view its data
You did not setup cloud properly, Showing detailed error messages, Too much open ports, weak database security, test accounts not deleted

3- Software Supply Chain
Using prebuilt things like libraries, frameworks etc are called software supply chain.
May be You install one npm package and internally it install 20 other npm package that may contain malware. Database, CI/CD you are using can be vulnerable

Scan for Vulnerabilities Regularly

Use tools like:

OWASP Dependency Check

Dependency Track

SCA tools


4- Cryptographic Failures
using weak encryption methods, storing plain passwords, credit card, using http, not validating certificatess


5- Injection
not validating, sanitazing user inputs, can lead to exposure of database or server 

6- Insecure design
not planning the security control, also perfect coding can be useless if design is not well planned.

If you build a bank app and:

You never design rate limiting

You never design anti-bot protection

You never design fraud detection

think like an attacker while designing this is called threat modeling


7- Authentication failures
not mainting the accurate login functionalitity, allowing default passwords, storing password in a plain text, weak hashing
storing session id in url, not invalidating session id after logout, incorrect jwt tokens



8- Software or data integrity failures
using insecure third party package or service 

A company uses an external service provider to provide support functionality. For convenience, it has a DNS mapping for myCompany.SupportProvider.com to support.myCompany.com. This means that all cookies, including authentication cookies, set on the myCompany.com domain will now be sent to the support provider. Anyone with access to the support provider’s infrastructure can steal the cookies of all of your users that have visited support.myCompany.com and perform a session hijacking attack.


9- Security Logging and Alerting failures
Not maintaining the proper logs, incomplete logs, exposing the log to the user


10- Mishandling of exceptional conditions
An exceptional condition is any unexpected situation that disrupts normal program flow.
